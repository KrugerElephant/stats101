Git and Github
-----------------

**Git**

A software tool for code version control

You can save snapshots of your code. Typically when you have a bug free and working version of your code, you "commit" (take a snap shot) of the code to your repository. You then continue to edit your code to add more functionality. But at times, your code may no longer work because of errors in your logic and you may want to revert back to the older version of your code. With git version control it is possible for you to retrieve older versions of your code.
